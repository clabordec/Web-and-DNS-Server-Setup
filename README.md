## Project Overview

### Introduction:
Setting up a web and DNS server is a common task for Linux system administrators responsible for hosting websites and managing domain name resolution. This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide for configuring and deploying a web server to host websites and a DNS server to manage domain name resolution. By following these guidelines, administrators can establish a reliable and secure infrastructure to serve web content and manage DNS records effectively.

### Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to equip Linux system administrators with the knowledge and skills needed to set up and configure a web server and DNS server infrastructure. This involves installing and configuring web server software, such as Apache or Nginx, configuring virtual hosts and SSL certificates, setting up DNS server software, such as BIND or dnsmasq, and managing DNS zones and records to facilitate domain name resolution for hosted websites.

### Key Components:

#### Web Server Setup

- <b>Selection of Web Server Software</b>: Choosing between Apache HTTP Server or Nginx based on performance requirements, features, and familiarity.
- <b>Installation and Configuration</b>: Installing the chosen web server software and configuring basic settings, such as listening ports, document root, and default web page.
- <b>Virtual Host Configuration</b>: Configuring virtual hosts to host multiple websites on a single server, including domain name-based and IP-based virtual hosts.
- <b>SSL/TLS Certificate Installation</b>: Obtaining and installing SSL/TLS certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) to enable HTTPS encryption for secure web communication.
- <b>Web Application Deployment</b>: Deploying web applications, content management systems (CMS), or static websites to the web server document root directory.
DNS Server Setup:

- <b>Selection of DNS Server Software</b>: Choosing between BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) or dnsmasq based on features, scalability, and complexity.
- <b>Installation and Configuration</b>: Installing the chosen DNS server software and configuring basic settings, such as listening interfaces, zone files, and DNS resolver settings.
- <b>Zone Configuration</b>: Creating and configuring DNS zones to manage domain names and associated records, including A, CNAME, MX, TXT, and PTR records.
- <b>Forward and Reverse DNS Lookup</b>: Configuring forward and reverse DNS lookup zones to map domain names to IP addresses and vice versa for proper domain name resolution.
- <b>DNSSEC Implementation</b>: Implementing DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) to add an extra layer of security to DNS queries and prevent DNS spoofing attacks.
Deliverables:

- <b>Comprehensive Documentation</b>: Detailed documentation outlining the setup and configuration procedures for the web and DNS servers, including installation steps, configuration options, and best practices.
- <b>Configured Web Server</b>: A fully configured and functional web server infrastructure capable of hosting multiple websites securely over HTTPS.
- <b>Deployed Web Applications</b>: Installed and deployed web applications or websites on the web server, accessible via domain names or IP addresses.
- <b>Configured DNS Server</b>: A configured and operational DNS server infrastructure capable of managing domain names and resolving DNS queries for hosted websites.
- <b>DNS Zone Configuration</b>: Configured DNS zones and records for domain names hosted on the DNS server, including forward and reverse lookup zones.
- <b>DNSSEC Implementation<b>: Implemented DNSSEC to enhance the security of DNS queries and protect against DNS spoofing attacks.
